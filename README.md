## About the Benchmark

The benchmark consists of 100 tasks drawn from established open-source benchmarks and custom challenges:

| Source | Percentage | Description |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| Custom | 20% | Custom page interaction challenges |
| WebBench | 20% | Hardest tasks from WebBench (read section) |
| OMI2W-2 | 20% | Hardest tasks from OMI2W-2 |
| GAIA | 20% | Hardest tasks from GAIA (web based) |
| BrowseComp | 20% | Hardest tasks from BrowseComp |

WebBench, Mind2Web 2, and BrowseComp are released under the MIT license. GAIA has no explicit license; to comply with its data policies, we only include tasks from the "fully public" validation split, and all tasks are base64 encoded to prevent data contamination.

Tasks were hand-selected for difficulty and verified to be achievable. Each task has been validated  to confirm it can be completed successfully.

**Important:** The task set is stored in base64 encoding to prevent web scrapers from inadvertently including the tasks in LLM training data. Please do not publish the tasks in plaintext or use them in model training data.

### Task Format

When decoded, the task file contains a JSON array. Each task has these fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `task_id` | Unique identifier for the task |
| `confirmed_task` | The task instruction to execute |
| `category` | Source benchmark category |
| `answer` | (optional) Ground truth answer if applicable |
